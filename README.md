About Rust:
Repo of resources from studying Rust.


Programming Rust:
Book examples repo: https://github.com/ProgrammingRust/examples
This repo (previously the whole thing was called 'programming-rust') origionally grew from this one book.
(chapters currently are top level items -> should be moved into subdirectory 'programming-rust')
Said chapters, covering 'the basics' probably won't be revisted from other sources (making these chapter items the imperfect go-to for said basics for this repo)
... there is no folder for chapter 20?


Dark Arts of Unsafe Rust:


Entirely too many linked lists:


The Rust Programming Language:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html
The official book (as a website)


Top level '00-\*' items: 
not chapters from 'programming-rust' but related topics arising from working through said book (not moved in the reorganisation (yet))
... and at least some of them are empty (and yet not in \_empty)
