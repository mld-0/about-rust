About Rust:
Repo of resources from studying Rust.


idioms/:
For clarifying Rust concepts.


programming-rust/:
Book examples repo: https://github.com/ProgrammingRust/examples
This repo (previously the whole thing was called 'programming-rust') origionally grew from this one book.
(chapters currently are top level items -> should be moved into subdirectory 'programming-rust')
Said chapters, covering 'the basics' probably won't be revisted from other sources (making these chapter items the imperfect go-to for said basics for this repo)
... there is no folder for chapter 20?
(Items named '00-'\*' are topics explored while reading book that are not chapters)

entirely-too-many-linked-lists/:
(previously work on 'Entirely Too Many Linked Lists' Rust exercises)


linked-list-exercises/:

Contains 'entirely-too-many-linked-lists' exercises (this time as an mdbook), and Rust LinkedList implementation for leetcode (with examples of common linked list actions)


the-rust-programming-language/:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html
